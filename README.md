# Bulma Coffee
A simple coffee website built with html,bulma and little bit javascript

# Inspiration
I wanted to learn how to make websites using Bulma framework. Instead of inventing an website, I wanted to try and see how hard would it be to implement one of my favourite coffee websites: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR6kNv83or0&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iXItWKbaQxcyDT1u6E7a8a&index=15). Full credits for user experience goes to them.

The website architecture/structure is mostly based on ideas I've seen in the youtube "Net Ninja Youtube channel. You can read more about it on their github: https://github.com/iamshaunjp
